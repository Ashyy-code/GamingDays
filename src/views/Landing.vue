    <h2>Hi there</h2>
    <p>This data is still young. I mean really young, like if this data was a girl, R-Kelly would be tryna pee on it.</p>
    <p>The report data will become more useful as the months go by, it continuously builds each day as people join VC and leave.</p>
    <h2>What is captured/stored?</h2>
    <p>Cool your trousers pal, only what discord API gives access to. Your discord Username, the time/day you join/leave a VC. Nothing that would doxx you if North Korea hacked my webserver. Or to put it better, nothing I couldn't gather myself with a pen and paper and some free time.</p>
    <p>Also only in servers where the GamingDays bot is.</p>
    <h2>Keyphrases..</h2>
    <p>When you say something that has a specific keyphrase in it, a counter against that keyphrase is incremented. The message isnt stored, the person who said it isnt stored. It just goes "oh i know that word.. bop!" and incerements the number of times that phrase was said.</p>
    <p>This data will eventually be paired with the Best Day data, to help realise which days people are more likely to ASK for VC as well as join it.</p>
